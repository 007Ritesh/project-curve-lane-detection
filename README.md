Project, curve lane detection!!
Curve Lane Detection is a computer vision project aimed at identifying and tracking lane markings on curved roads. This project is particularly useful for autonomous driving systems, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and navigation systems that need to understand and interpret road lane information.

Features
Curve Detection: Accurately identifies and tracks lane markings on curved roads.
Real-time Processing: Processes video streams or camera feeds in real-time.
Robust to Noise: Handles various road conditions, lighting changes, and lane marking variations.
Visualization: Provides visual feedback with annotated lane markings overlaid on the input video.
